This file contains my (Doug Tavolette's) ideas to try for OSP so that I know what procedures to do

1) OSP just on the original image with target set to the undertext on the top right
2) OSP to pull out the overtext to create a mask to use for later procedures
3) OSP after PCA to see if I can get any additional undertext compared to idea 1
4) Add more blue bands to see where the line between over and undertext showing up is
